# BorrowIt Client

This client is powered by React, and was built using `create-react-app`. Please consult the `create-react-app` [documentation](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md) if you have questions on how to do something (like adding a dependency or writing test files). 

We are using `npm` for this project as it has proven to be more reliable over various development ecosystems.
